# IDEA
The idea is to make a customized GPA Calculator App which is independent of college & subject credits i.e. User can edit
these details.

# LAYOUTS
XML is used in designing this app. (Will add full description of each layout)


# PURPOSE
Currently, it's a basic gpa calculator app for the students of SRM of Batches 2014 & 2015 only. The app was made as 
a self-learning project.


  ## Skills learned
  Facebook Integration : User need to signin through facebook to use this app. Facebook SDK is used in this.
  Changed Layout dynamically: Adding edit text for subjects' grade & credit
  ## As Project in College
  It was my college mini-Project. The full presentation will be uploaded soon.
  
# STATUS: Complete

# Improvements to Do in Future
To make it a customized GPA Caculator so that student of every college can use it.
